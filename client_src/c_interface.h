/* Example of providing an interface to VRPN client-side objects through C.
 * Initially made to handle the Tracker and Button objects, for the purpose
 * of connecting to a Spaceball through Fortran.  If you know how to link
 * C and C++ code into Fortran, then you should be able to use it to link.
 * (Note, you may need to add an underscore to the name of the C functions.)
 * Also note, the implementation code is C++ code, but exposes its functions using
 * a C interface.
