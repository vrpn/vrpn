/* This program will ping a VRPN server and time how long it takes the server
   that is being pinged to respond.  It makes use of the VRPN ping/pong
   mechanism by which objects detect if they have connected to servers.
   It gives an indication of the round-trip time from a message at the user
   level from a client through the user level at a server.
