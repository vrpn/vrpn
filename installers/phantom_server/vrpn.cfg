# This file provides comments and examples for the vrpn.cfg file that is read
# by the vrpn_server application when it starts up. This is a generic server
# application that can start up many but maybe not all servers.
#
# This has sample lines for a vrpn.cfg file.  If you get a new device working,
# add a line for it here.  DO NOT remove lines from this file (unless
# devices are declared obsolete) - just change the actual vrpn.cfg to match
# your application.
#
# All examples in the file are preceded by comment characters (#). To actually
# use one of these examples, remove that character from the beginning of all the
# examples that you want to use, and edit those lines to suit your environment.

# Fastrak Tracker. Runs a Polhemus Fastrak tracker that is attached to a serial
# port on this machine. This driver will also run an InterSense IS600 or IS900
# tracker, but you will want to include extra initialization code (as described
# below) to set up the ultrasonic pip information, wand devices, stylus devices
# and so forth.  Arguments that go on the first line:
#	char	name_of_this_device[]
#	char	name_of_serial_device[]
#	int	baud_rate_of_serial_device
#
# It is possible to add additional commands that will be sent to the tracker
# by putting the backslash character (\) at the end of the config line. This
# will cause the following line to be read in and sent to the Fastrak during
# the reset routine. You can add additional lines by putting a slash at the
# end of each command line but the last. Each line will be sent to the Fastrak
# with a newline at the end of it. If a line starts with an asterisk (*), then
# it is treated as a line telling how long to sleep, with the integer number of
# seconds following the *.
#
# If one or more sensors on the Fastrak have a stylus button on them, use
# the "FTStylus" command after the reset command lines (if any).  There should
# be a front-slash "/" character at the end of the line before the FTStylus
# command.  The command takes two arguments: the name of the button device
# that will report the buttons and the sensor number to which the button is
# attached (the first sensor is sensor 0).
#
# Commands to add Joysticks (2 buttons) or Wands (5 buttons and 2 analogs) to
# the various sensors on the Isense900 are done by adding Stylus and
# Wand command lines after the reset command lines.  Each of these lines
# takes two arguments: the name of the button (for Stylus) or button and
# analog (for Wand) servers, and the sensor number (starting from 0).  The
# Wand line takes eight additional parameters, which specify the scaling
# and clipping behavior of the two directions on the analog joystick.  Each
# set of for is the min, lowzero, hizero, and max values: these are mapped
# to -1, 0,0, and 1 (all values between lowzero and hizero are mapped to 0).
# Start with these at -1,0,0,1 and use the 'printcereal' program or some other
# method to read them and see what the range of acheivable values is.  Then,
# set them to slightly conservative values so that the whole range is covered
# and the analogs will report zero when the joystick is centered. The
# presence of these lines is indicated by placing them after any additional
# reset command lines, by ending the line preceding them with the front slash
# "/" character.
#
# Remember that the "remote" button object is not the same as the the tracking
# device, so be sure to use a remote button object that connects to the button
# rather than the tracker.  The button device name is defined on the stylus or
# wand line in the config file, and should not be the same as the tracker.  In
# the case described by the example configuration below, if the name of the
# machine running the server is "myis900server" you would connect to the tracker
# as "Isense900@myis900server" and to the buttons on the stylus as
# "Stylus0@myis900server":
#
# Note that this frontslash and backslash-notation can only be used for the
# Fastrak/Isense tracker, not to extend the line for any other type of device
# listed in this configuration file.

# AnalogFly Tracker. This is a tracker that is intended to be used on top of
# a joystick or motion tracker of some kind to turn it into a moving or flying
# device. It could be used on top of any analog device, in fact.
#   This device basically takes in analog signals and puts out transformation
# matrices. It should supercede the JoyFly tracker, since it is more general.
#   There are two kinds of JoyFly's: absolute ones and differential ones.  For
# absolute ones, the analog value is mapped directly to position or orientation
# on each axis.  For differential ones, the values are used to create a
# "change" matrix that is applied once per interval, accumulating changes as
# it goes; this enables the user to "fly" along by holding a joystick forward,
# for example.
#   One analog channel is associated with each axis (X, Y, Z) and rotation about
# each axis (RX, RY, RZ). For each axis, the value is converted to a position
# (meters) or speed (meters/second) for absolute trackers; or into an
# orientation (revolutions) or angular velocity (revolutions/second) by first
# subtracting an offset, then thresholding it to see if it is far enough from
# zero, then (if it is) scaling it and taking it to a power (to allow nonlinear
# speedup as the stick is pushed far from center).
#   A button can be associated with a reset function, which will take the
# device back to center (identity transformation). The device will also recenter
# when the first connection is made to the server it is running on. (Centering
# has no effect on absolute AnalogFlys).
#   Any axis or the reset button can be disabled by setting the name of its
# associated device to the string "NULL".
#   Note that you could have multiple of these devices running simultaneously,
# each with a different name and interaction metaphor. The user could then
# connect to their favorite one. Arguments:

# JoyFly Tracker. A vrpn_Tracker that translates the vrpn_Joystick into
# Walkthrough- convention tracker reports. This is part of a two-part setup
# that allows you to use a joystick as a flying device. First, a joystick
# device has to be created (named joybox in our example) that will produce
# the analog inputs that the JoyFly tracker uses to determine the transformation.
# Then, the JoyFly device needs to be started and will listen to the device
# and produce tracker reports. If these are both run on the same server, then
# the JoyFly needs to use the "server" connection to hear from the Joystick
# device, which is indicated by placing a '*' in front of the name of the

# ButtonFly Tracker. This is a tracker that is intended to be used on top of
# a Global Haptics Orb or other buttond device to turn it into a moving or
# flying device.  It basically takes in button signals and puts out
# transformation matrices.
#   There are two kinds of Buttons: absolute ones and differential ones.  For
# absolute ones, pressing it causes the position or orientation associated with
# it to be stored directly into the transformation.  This enables the user to
# "teleport" to given locations by pressing buttons.  For differential ones,
# the position or orientation are treated as deltas and are used to create a
# "change" matrix that is applied once per interval, accumulating changes as
# it goes; this enables the user to "fly" along by holding a button down,
# for example.
#   Each button is associated with either a position (meters) or speed
# (meters/second) for absolute buttons; or an orientation (revolutions)
# or angular velocity (revolutions/second).
#   An analog channel can be associated with a scale function that scales the
# velocity or angular velocity terms uniformly.  The entry specifies an
# offset to be applied to the analog channel, a scale to be applied to it,
# and a power to which the result should be taken; the end result is used
# to scale all velocity or angular velocity terms.  This channel has no
# effect on the effects of absolute buttons.
#   The device will recenter (set itself to the identity transform) when the
# first connection is made to the server it is running on.

# from the button that is pressed
# for all of the standard buttons.  It rotates around the Y axis when the
# rocker switch is rocked up and down.  It resets to the origin when one
# of the pushbuttons is pressed.  Both the velocity and angular velocity
# are controlled by the thumbwheel.
