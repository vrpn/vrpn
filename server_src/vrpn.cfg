# vrpn.cfg SAMPLE for VRPN version @CONFIG_VERSION@

################################################################################
################################################################################
# This file provides comments and examples for the vrpn.cfg file that is read
# by the vrpn_server application when it starts up. This is a generic server
# application that can start up many but maybe not all servers.
#
# This has sample lines for a vrpn.cfg file.  If you get a new device working,
# add a line for it here.  DO NOT remove lines from this file (unless
# devices are declared obsolete) - just change the actual vrpn.cfg to match
# your application.
#
# All examples in the file are preceded by comment characters (#). To actually
# use one of these examples, remove that character from the beginning of all the
# examples that you want to use, and edit those lines to suit your environment.

# NOTE: for useERT: use nothing, y or Y if you have an extended range
# transmitter, use N or n if not (added by David Nahon for Virtools
# VRPack/SAS Cube.
# NOTE: The "invert_quaternion" parameter was added because there was a
# conflict between the code that had been around since VRPN started and

# Flock in the "wrong" hemisphere, which inverted the orientation relative
# to the position.  The old behavior is obtained by specifying "1".  Not
# inverting it is specified using "0".
# NOTE: active hemisphere is one of "+x", "-x", "+y", "-y", "+z", "-z"
# If "active_hemisphere" is not specified, it defaults to +z.

# Flock-of-birds in parallel Tracker. Runs an Ascension Flock of Birds tracker

# Fastrak Tracker. Runs a Polhemus Fastrak tracker that is attached to a serial
# port on this machine. This driver will also run an InterSense IS600 or IS900
# tracker, but you will want to include extra initialization code (as described
# below) to set up the ultrasonic pip information, wand devices, stylus devices
# and so forth.  Arguments that go on the first line:
#	char	name_of_this_device[]
#	char	name_of_serial_device[]
#	int	baud_rate_of_serial_device
#
# It is possible to add additional commands that will be sent to the tracker
# by putting the backslash character (\) at the end of the config line. This
# will cause the following line to be read in and sent to the Fastrak during
# the reset routine. You can add additional lines by putting a slash at the
# end of each command line but the last. Each line will be sent to the Fastrak
# with a newline at the end of it. If a line starts with an asterisk (*), then
# it is treated as a line telling how long to sleep, with the integer number of
# seconds following the *.
#
# If one or more sensors on the Fastrak have a stylus button on them, use
# the "FTStylus" command after the reset command lines (if any).  There should
# be a front-slash "/" character at the end of the line before the FTStylus
# command.  The command takes two arguments: the name of the button device
# that will report the buttons and the sensor number to which the button is
# attached (the first sensor is sensor 0).
#
# Commands to add Joysticks (2 buttons) or Wands (5 buttons and 2 analogs) to
# the various sensors on the Isense900 are done by adding Stylus and
# Wand command lines after the reset command lines.  Each of these lines
# takes two arguments: the name of the button (for Stylus) or button and
# analog (for Wand) servers, and the sensor number (starting from 0).  The
# Wand line takes eight additional parameters, which specify the scaling
# and clipping behavior of the two directions on the analog joystick.  Each
# set of for is the min, lowzero, hizero, and max values: these are mapped
# to -1, 0,0, and 1 (all values between lowzero and hizero are mapped to 0).
# Start with these at -1,0,0,1 and use the 'printcereal' program or some other
# method to read them and see what the range of acheivable values is.  Then,
# set them to slightly conservative values so that the whole range is covered
# and the analogs will report zero when the joystick is centered. The
# presence of these lines is indicated by placing them after any additional
# reset command lines, by ending the line preceding them with the front slash
# "/" character.
#
# Remember that the "remote" button object is not the same as the the tracking
# device, so be sure to use a remote button object that connects to the button
# rather than the tracker.  The button device name is defined on the stylus or
# wand line in the config file, and should not be the same as the tracker.  In
# the case described by the example configuration below, if the name of the
# machine running the server is "myis900server" you would connect to the tracker
# as "Isense900@myis900server" and to the buttons on the stylus as
# "Stylus0@myis900server":
#
# Note that this frontslash and backslash-notation can only be used for the
# Fastrak/Isense tracker, not to extend the line for any other type of device
# listed in this configuration file.

# AnalogFly Tracker. This is a tracker that is intended to be used on top of
# a joystick or motion tracker of some kind to turn it into a moving or flying
# device. It could be used on top of any analog device, in fact.
#   This device basically takes in analog signals and puts out transformation
# matrices. It should supercede the JoyFly tracker, since it is more general.
#   There are two kinds of JoyFly's: absolute ones and differential ones.  For
# absolute ones, the analog value is mapped directly to position or orientation
# on each axis.  For differential ones, the values are used to create a
# "change" matrix that is applied once per interval, accumulating changes as
# it goes; this enables the user to "fly" along by holding a joystick forward,
# for example.
#   One analog channel is associated with each axis (X, Y, Z) and rotation about
# each axis (RX, RY, RZ). For each axis, the value is converted to a position
# (meters) or speed (meters/second) for absolute trackers; or into an
# orientation (revolutions) or angular velocity (revolutions/second) by first
# subtracting an offset, then thresholding it to see if it is far enough from
# zero, then (if it is) scaling it and taking it to a power (to allow nonlinear
# speedup as the stick is pushed far from center).
#   A button can be associated with a reset function, which will take the
# device back to center (identity transformation). The device will also recenter
# when the first connection is made to the server it is running on. (Centering
# has no effect on absolute AnalogFlys).
#   A button can be associated with a clutch function, which will mean that
# the device will not move unless the clutch is pressed, so you can use it
# like a mouse and continue to move by pulling to the right with the button
# down and then to the left with the button up.  For differential analogflys,
# clutching makes the tracker not move unless the button is pressed.  For
# absolute ones, it only moves when the button is pressed and the mouse is
# moving; it offsets to enable long-range motions in a finite tracking area,
# as with a mouse.
#   Any axis or the reset button can be disabled by setting the name of its
# associated device to the string "NULL".

# JoyFly Tracker. A vrpn_Tracker that translates the vrpn_Joystick into
# Walkthrough- convention tracker reports. This is part of a two-part setup
# that allows you to use a joystick as a flying device. First, a joystick
# device has to be created (named joybox in our example) that will produce
# the analog inputs that the JoyFly tracker uses to determine the transformation.
# Then, the JoyFly device needs to be started and will listen to the device
# and produce tracker reports. If these are both run on the same server, then
# the JoyFly needs to use the "server" connection to hear from the Joystick
# device, which is indicated by placing a '*' in front of the name of the
# joystick device that it is to use. If the joystick device is remote from
# this server, then the full name of it should be used (joystick@foo.cs.unc.edu).

# ButtonFly Tracker. This is a tracker that is intended to be used on top of
# a Global Haptics Orb or other buttond device to turn it into a moving or
# flying device.  It basically takes in button signals and puts out
# transformation matrices.
#   There are two kinds of Buttons: absolute ones and differential ones.  For
# absolute ones, pressing it causes the position or orientation associated with
# it to be stored directly into the transformation.  This enables the user to
# "teleport" to given locations by pressing buttons.  For differential ones,
# the position or orientation are treated as deltas and are used to create a
# "change" matrix that is applied once per interval, accumulating changes as
# it goes; this enables the user to "fly" along by holding a button down,
# for example.
#   Each button is associated with either a position (meters) or speed
# (meters/second) for absolute buttons; or an orientation (revolutions)
# or angular velocity (revolutions/second).
#   An analog channel can be associated with a scale function that scales the
# velocity or angular velocity terms uniformly.  The entry specifies an
# offset to be applied to the analog channel, a scale to be applied to it,
# and a power to which the result should be taken; the end result is used
# to scale all velocity or angular velocity terms.  This channel has no
# effect on the effects of absolute buttons.
#   The device will recenter (set itself to the identity transform) when the
# first connection is made to the server it is running on.
#   Note that you could have multiple of these devices running simultaneously,
# each with a different name and interaction metaphor. The user could then
# connect to their favorite one. Arguments:

#
# See also vrpn_5DT16 (16-sensor serial) and vrpn_Analog_5dtUSB (5 or 14-sensor
# "Ultra" USB/wireless)
#
# 2 modes are driven: the first one let the driver get data from the glove
# when requested (we advise this mode). The second one makes the glove send
# data continuously. This mode may saturate the input buffer.
#
# The manual states that there will be 9 bytes per report, but one group
# has found that they get an extra one: 0x55 at the end of each report.
# So, you can choose whether to use 9 (the default) or 10 now.
# Gesture management is not implemented yet nor the mouse emulation mode
#
# The standard baud rate for the "wired" glove is 19200. For a "wireless"
# glove (which is send-only), even if directly connected, use baud rate
# 9600. The driver detects this and will adjust its behavior accordingly
# (forcing on continuous mode and 10-bytes-per-report, ignoring the settings
# you specify here).  If you aren't  sure what kind of glove you have, use the
# Glove Manager app in
# "5DT Data Glove Series: Full Package for Windows 95/98/NT/2000" downloaded from
# http://5dt.com/downloads.html and try to connect, it will tell you.

#PhaseSpace OWL server.  This device type is not compiled by default, since
#it uses a proprietary library.  However, you can get it to compile by
#defining VRPN_INCLUDE_PHASESPACE and including the appropriate libraries
#and headers when compiling (See vrpn_Configure.h).
#
#Arguments:
#       char	name_of_this_tracker[]   #Tracker0, Tracker1, ... etc
#       char    location_of_OWL_device[] #typically localhost, or ip address
#       float   frame_rate               #between 0.0 and 480.0
#       int     read_till_most_recent    #0 or 1.
#       int     slave_mode               #0 or 1.
#       [Additional lines specifying markers and rigid bodies]
#
#Specifying a frequency >0 will start streaming immediately at startup.
#To delay this, set the frequency to zero and adjust the update rate later.
#
#Specifying 1 for read_till_most_recent will cause the server to drop frames
#in order to get the most recent data on every run through the mainloop.
#This may be desirable for most VR applications and for slower machines.
#
#The format of the additional lines is as follows:
#
#Example:
#
#vrpn_Tracker_PhaseSpace Tracker0 localhost 480.0 1 0
#<owl>
#0 :     rbnew
#1 :     rb+     0      0       300     0
#2 :     rb+     1      300     0       0
#3 :     rb+     2      -300    0       0
#4 :     rb+     3      0       76      -200
#5 :     pt      4
#6 :     pt      5
#7 :     pt      6    #this is a comment
#8 :     pt      8
#9 :     pt      9
#</owl>
#
#
#
#       In regular expression syntax:
#       sensornumber : spectype led_id [xcoord  ycoord  zcoord]
#
#       The <owl> and </owl> tags indicate the start and end of the marker
#       and rigid body specifications.  Each line inside the tags correspond
#       to a sensor specified by the first number in the line.  Register
#       callbacks as necessary.  The # character will cause the rest of
#       the line to be ignored.  Do not assign duplicate sensors.
#
#       There are 4 spectypes: "rbnew", "rb+", and "pt".
#
#       "pt" indicates a normal marker specification.
#       The number following it indicates the led id to assign to that sensor.
#       No further arguments are needed for the rest of the line. The vrpn
#       server will return position data for that marker but no orientation
#       data.
#
#       "rbnew" indicates a new rigid body specification.  The lines following
#       it must be "rb+" lines, indicating the addition of markers to the
#       rigid body.  The "rb+" lines must have the x,y, and z coordinates of
#       the rigid body marker specified after the led id.  The rigid body
#       itself is assigned the sensor of the "rbnew" line, and the markers
#       in the rigid body are given the sensor numbers of the "rb+" lines.
#       The rigid body specification continues until another "rbnew" line is
#       encountered or until the </owl> tag.  If "pt" lines are mixed in, they
#       do not affect the rigid body. Rigid bodies will return an orientation
#       as well as positional data.
#
#       Empty or invalid lines inside the <owl> and </owl> tags are also
#       ignored.
#
#       Care must be taken to AVOID specifying the same led id or sensor twice,
#       sensors and led ids should be unique.
#
#       The OWL server (not just the vrpn server) must still be configured to
#       track the specified markers.  Consult the PhaseSpace documentation to
#       see how.
#
#
#       Velocities and accelerations are not currently supported.
#
#       The frequency of streaming can be varied with set_update_rate()
#       in vrpn_Tracker_Remote. To stop streaming, set the update rate to
#       zero.

# Razer Hydra (Sixense TrueMotion) tracker (HID-based driver)
#
# The left wand (the one with LB and LT on its "end" buttons - look from above)
# is sensor 0, and the right wand (with RB and RT on it) is sensor 1.
# The "front" of the base is the side opposite the cables: there's a small
# logo on it. You can have the base in any orientation you want, but the info
# that follows assumes you have the base sitting on a desk, with the front toward you.
# If you have the base in a different coordinate frame in the world, please make
# the appropriate mental transformations yourself. :)
#
# When starting the VRPN server, make sure that the left wand is somewhere to
# the left of the base, and the right wand somewhere right of the base -
# they do not need to be placed on the base or any more complicated homing/calibration
# procedure. This is for the hemisphere tracking: it needs to have an "initial state"
# that is roughly known, so it uses the sign of the X coordinate position.
#
# The base coordinate system is right-handed with the axes:
#  X - out the right of the base
#  Y - out the front of the base
#  Z - down
#
# The wands are also right-handed, with the tracked point somewhere near
# the cable entry to the controller . When held with the joystick vertical,
# the axes are:
#  X - to the right
#  Y - out the front of the controller (trigger buttons)
#  Z - Up, along the joystick
#
#  Buttons are as follows, with the right controller's button channels starting
# at 8 instead of 0:
#  0 - "middle" button below joystick
#  1-4 - numbered buttons
#  5 - "bumper" button (above trigger)
#  6 - joystick button (if you push straight down on the joystick)
#  There is no button 7 on any controller; the offset of 8 per controller
# was done to make similar buttons differ by a power of 2.
#
# Analog channels are as follows, with the right controller starting at 3
# instead of 0:
#  0 - joystick left/right: centered at 0, right is positive, in [-1, 1]
#  1 - joystick up/down: centered at 0, up is positive, in [-1, 1]
#  2 - analog trigger, in range 0 (not pressed) to 1 (fully pressed).
#
# Arguments:
#   char    name_of_this_device[]
#
# NOTE: If using the Hydra on Windows, the server will work with or without the official
# Razer Hydra drivers installed. If you are only using the device with VRPN, don't
# install the official drivers. However, if you do have them installed, make sure that
# the "Hydra Configurator" and the Hydra system tray icon are closed to avoid unexpected
# failure (their software can switch the device out of the mode that VRPN uses). You
# probably want to make sure that the tray icon doesn't auto-run on startup, since it
# can get even messier with Windows 7's "switch users" if you let it auto-run for each
# user.
#
# Works great on Linux (regardless of endianness) - no drivers needed, thanks to USB HID.
#
# NOTE: Because of the jitter in the tracker, you may want to add a
# filter to it and then read the filtered location values; you still read
# the buttons and analogs from the original device.

# Arrington Research ViewPoint EyeTracker.
#
# The VRPN server connects to the eye tracker using the VPX_InterApp DLL.
# Whatever other control software is being used to connect to the eye tracker
# (e.g. the ViewPoint software that comes with the tracker) to perform
# calibration, etc. should link to the same copy of the DLL, so they can share
# information.
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Tracker:
#
# The tracker has two sensors, as the ViewPoint can optionally have binocular
# tracking.  In the case of monocular tracking, only sensor 0 (EYE_A) will have
# valid information.  Retrieving smoothed or raw tracking data is controlled by
# the smoothedData parameter.
#
# Position: The (x,y) gaze point in gaze space (smoothed or raw).
#
# Rotation: The (x,y) gaze angle as a quaternion (smoothed or raw).
#
# Velocity: The x- and y- components of the eye movement velocity in gaze space
# (always smoothed).
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Analog:
#
# There are a lot of additional data that can be retrieved from the tracker.
# These values are always calculated from the smoothed gaze point.  Currently,
# the following are sent as analog values, but more can be added as needed.
# Please see the ViewPoint documentation regarding what other data are available.
#
# Because each channel needs to be duplicated in the case of a binocular tracker,
# the first n/2 values are for EYE_A, and the second n/2 values are for EYE_B.
#
# EYE_A:
#
# Channel 0: The pupil aspect ratio, from 0.0 to 1.0.  Can be used to detect
#            blinks when it falls below a given threshold.
#
# Channel 1: The total velocity (magnitude of eye movement velocity).  Can be
#            used to detect saccades.
#
# Channel 2: The fixation seconds (length of time below the velocity criterion
#            used to detect saccades).  0 if saccade is occurring.
#
# EYE_B:

# The command for a FastrakPDI requires the tracker name, and the server name for the tracker:
#
# vrpn_Tracker_FastrakPDI Fastrak\       <-valid
# vrpn_Tracker_FastrakPDI Highpoint\     <-valid
#
# The '\' at the end of the first line, after the server name, is optional and will be disregarded.
#   a '\' on a subsequent line means that further commands are to be input. The format is to have
#   one command per line.  Each line that isn't the final line must end in a '\'.  The final line should not
#   have a '\' on the end.
#
# Supported Fastrak Configuration Commands:
#   All commands are exposed, except C and c for continuous pno which would conflict with VRPN directly.
#   Take note that O<> should be avoided, though it will be sent to the tracker.  VRPN clients expect position
#   x,y,z and quaternion q,r,s,t by default, so changing the frame structure could result in an overflow.
#   The format commands ('F' for ASCII, f for binary) are especially useful since the tracker can mark
#   syntax errors in ASCII mode.  The tracker must be in binary mode for VRPN to gather data, so if you issue
#   an F command at some point in this file (to troubleshoot syntax errors), be sure to issue an f<>
#   command later.  Not all fastrak commands have a response: boresight, for example.  You can confirm
#   such settings by requesting a single frame in ASCII mode with the command P (note, P requires no <>).
#   Read the fastrak manual for a full list of commands.
#
# Command Syntax:
#   Many commands, much like P (gather single pno frame), require no carriage return on the end.  Carriage
#   returns are represented by '<>'.  Control commands, noted as ^$ (where $ is any capitol letter) in the
#   manual require a '^' followed by the capital letter for the command.  Syntax is precisely as given in
#   examples in the fastrak manual.  Note that all commands are case sensitive.
#    Examples:
#     F              <-Sets the response frame format to ASCII
#     f              <-Sets the response frame format to binary
#     b*<>           <-Removes the boresight setting for all sensors
#     B1<>           <-Sets the boresight to 0,0,0 as a default or whatever G<> was set to
#     G1,0,0,0<>     <-Sets the boresight reference angles of station 1 to 0,0,0
#     ^Y             <-Sends a reset command to the tracker, note that VRPN defaults for pno will be loaded on
#                       reconnect
#
# If a sensor on the FasTrak device is a Polhemus FasTrak Stylus, use the "PDIStylus"
#   command.  This command takes one argument: the station number of the stylus device.  Remember that
#   the station number is a 1-based index of sensors/'stations' on the Polhemus equipment.
#   PDIStylus command syntax:
#
#   PDIStylus [station-num]
#
#   Use of the PDIStylus command will
#   - Cause the Stylus Button Flag to be configured into the output of all stations.
#   - Cause the creation of vrpn button device.  The name of this device will be a concatenation of
#		the server name for the tracker + "Stylus" + the specified station number.
#       E.g:
#			vrpn_Tracker_FasTrakPDI   myFT \
#           PDIStylus 1
#
#           Will produce a button device named "myFTStylus1"
#
#       Remember that the "remote" button object is not the same as the the tracking device, so be sure
#       to use a remote button object that connects to the button rather than the tracker.
#       In this example configuration, if the name of the machine running the server is "mytrackerserver"
#       you would connect to the tracker as "myFT@mytrackerserver" and to the button on the stylus as
#       "myFTStylus1@mytrackerserver"
#
#   NOTE:  The FasTrak tracker will only detect stylus input if the stylus is plugged into Station 1!
#          However, the stylus flag can be output onto any station on the device.  Therefore, it is
#          possible to specify station 2 as your PDIStylus button, and the stylus output will be collected
#          from the Station 2 output.  BUT the actual Stylus device must be plugged into Station 1.
#          This means that only one Stylus can be plugged into a FasTrak at any time, but up to 4 vrpn
#          button objects can be created/accessed from that Stylus.
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The command for a LibertyPDI or PatriotPDI requires the tracker name, and the server name for the tracker:
#
# vrpn_Tracker_LibertyPDI Liberty\       <-valid
# vrpn_Tracker_LibertyPDI Patriot\       <-valid
# vrpn_Tracker_LibertyPDI BriansTracker\ <-valid
# vrpn_Tracker_PatriotPDI Patriot\       <-Not valid.  Use vrpn_Tracker_LibertyPDI for patriot and liberty
#
# The '\' at the end of the first line, after the server name, is optional and will be disregarded.
#   a '\' on a subsequent line means that further commands are to be input. The format is to have
#   one command per line.  Each line that isn't the final line must end in a '\'.  The final line should not
#   have a '\' on the end.
#
# Supported Liberty/Patriot Configuration Commands:
#   All commands are accepted, except C<> for continuous pno output which would conflict with VRPN directly.
#   Take note that O<> should be avoided, though it will be sent to the tracker.  VRPN clients expect position
#   x,y,z and quaternion q,r,s,t by default, so changing the frame structure could result in an overflow.
#   The format command (F0<> for ASCII, F1<> for binary) is especially useful since the tracker can mark
#   syntax errors in ASCII mode.  The tracker must be in binary mode for VRPN to gather data, so if you issue
#   an F0<> command at the beginning of this file (to troubleshoot syntax errors), be sure to issue an F1<>
#   command later.  Not all liberty/patriot commands have a response: boresight, for example.  You can confirm
#   these settings by requesting a single frame in ASCII mode with the command P (note, P requires no <>).
#   Read the patriot or liberty manual for a full list of commands.
#
# Command Syntax:
#   Every command, except P (gather single pno frame), requires a carriage return on the end.  Carriage
#   returns are represented by '<>'.  Control commands, noted as ^X (where X is any capitol letter) in the
#   manual require a '^' followed by the capital letter for the command.  Syntax is precisely as given in
#   examples in the patriot/liberty manuals.
#    Examples:
#     ^V<>            <-This command sends a 'whoami' request to the tracker.  Requires ascii mode for response
#     F<>             <-Queries format mode of tracker (binary or ascii)
#     F0<>            <-Sets the response frame format to ASCII
#     F1<>            <-Sets the response frame format to binary
#     ^B*<>           <-Removes the boresight setting for all sensors
#     B1<>            <-Queries the boresight setting for sensor one
#     B1,0,0,0,0      <-Sets the boresight to 0,0,0 without a reset for sensor one
#     ^Y<>            <-Sends a reset command to the tracker, note that VRPN defaults for pno will be loaded on
#                       reconnect
#
# If one or more sensors on the polhemus device is a Polhemus Stylus, use the "PDIStylus"
#   command.  This command takes one argument: the station number of the stylus device.  Remember that
#   the station number is a 1-based index of sensors/'stations' on the Polhemus equipment.
#   PDIStylus command syntax:
#
#   PDIStylus [station-num]
#
#   Use of the PDIStylus command will
#   - Cause the Stylus Button Flag to be configured into the output of all stations.
#   - Cause the creation of vrpn button device.  The name of this device will be a concatenation of
#		the server name for the tracker + "Stylus" + the specified station number.
#       E.g:
#			vrpn_Tracker_LibertyPDI   myliberty \
#           PDIStylus 2
#
#           Will produce a button device named "mylibertyStylus2"
#
#       Remember that the "remote" button object is not the same as the the tracking device, so be sure
#       to use a remote button object that connects to the button rather than the tracker.
#       In this example configuration, if the name of the machine running the server is "mytrackerserver"
#       you would connect to the tracker as "myliberty@mytrackerserver" and to the button on this stylus as
#       "mylibertyStylus2@mytrackerserver"
#
#   NOTE:  The Liberty and Patriots tracker will detect stylus button input on any station, and there is
#          no limit on the number of Stylus devices that can be connected to the tracker.  Only one vrpn
#          button object can be created per stylus.
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following example config:
# -specifies that stations 1 and 2 are Polhemus Stylus Devices
# -sets the tracker to ASCII responses (F0<>),
# -sends the tracker a whoami (^V<>),
# -sets the boresight on sensor one (B1,0,0,0,0<>) to an arbitrary value,
# -confirms the boresight setting with P to collect a single pno,
# -removes the boresight setting (^B1<>),
# -collects a second single pno to confirm (P),
# -enters an invalid command to demonstrate the advantage of ASCII mode (^ZX<>) and finally,
# -most importantly, returns to binary mode before passing control to VRPN (F1<>).
# The tracker server name is TrackerJohn.

# This YEI 3Space_Sensor driver is used even for a wireless-capable sensor
# when it is plugged directly into the computer via USB.  The Wireless
# driver (see next driver description) is used when the wireless unit is
# plugged into the computer.
#
# On Windows, the driver for the YEI 3-Space Sensor Suite requires installation
# of the device driver that comes with the system, which presents a serial-port
# interface to the device (as a COM port on Windows).  On Mac and Linux, you
# can just plug in the device and it will show up as a new port.  On Linux, the
# default permissions for the port only allow read access, so you'll need to
# either change the permissions or run vrpn_server as root.
#   If the gyroscopes are calibrated at startup, the device should remain still
# while the server is started.
#   If the device is set to tare at startup, it should be facing in the correct
# direction when the server is started. This is usually a manufacturing-time
# operation if the tracker is integrated into a larger device.
#
# This device exposes a Tracker interface, with the following inputs.  Only the
# orientation portion of the pose is valid; the position is always reported as
# (0,0,0).  Sensor 1 also reports linear acceleration.
#  0: Untared orientation
#  1: Tared orientation
#
# This device exports an Analog interface, with the following channels:
#  0: Corrected Gyro rate vector X component (radians/second)
#  1: Corrected Gyro rate vector Y component (radians/second)
#  2: Corrected Gyro rate vector Z component (radians/second)
#  3: Corrected Gravity vector X component (in fraction of g)
#  4: Corrected Gravity vector Y component (in fraction of g)
#  5: Corrected Gravity vector Z component (in fraction of g)
#  6: Corrected Compass vector X component (in Gauss)
#  7: Corrected Compass vector Y component (in Gauss)
#  8: Corrected Compass vector Z component (in Gauss)
#  9: Temperature Celsius
#  10: Confidence factor (1 if completely stationary down to 0 with motion)
#
# This device exports a Button_Filter interface, with the following channels:
#  0: First button (external button on the units in cases)
#  1: Second button (external button on the units in cases)
#  2-7: Other buttons (not installed at the factory)

#       it will show up as another display.
#
# NOTE: The magnetometer ranges on each axis are different, and they are not
