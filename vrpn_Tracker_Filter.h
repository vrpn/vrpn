	@brief Header for a class of trackers that read from one tracker and
        apply a filter to the inputs, sending out filtered outputs under a
        different tracker name.  The initial instance is the one-Euro filter.
        Others include various predictive and combining tracker filters.

/** @brief Tracker filter based on the one-Euro filter by Jan Ciger
	<jan.ciger@reviatech.com>

    This class reads values from the specified tracker, then applies the
    one-Euro filter to its values and reports them as another tracker.
    This lets you filter any device type.  It was originally written to
    be used with the Razer Hydra tracker.
